Your idea for an integrated administrative system tailored for small businesses is indeed detailed and appears to be well-thought-out. It encompasses a range of microservices, from email handling and stock control to data analysis and social media integration, all under a unified backend powered by Flask and MongoDB. Moreover, the incorporation of GPT-powered agents for each microservice is a novel approach to enhance communication and problem-solving within the system.

In researching the competitive landscape, several noteworthy players emerged, providing a range of administrative and management solutions for small businesses:

1. **Connecteam**:
   - Features: Time clock management, employee scheduling, task management, HR & People Management, and several other functionalities aimed at improving business operations and communicatio.
   
2. **Zoho One**:
   - Features: Over 40 integrated business applications covering sales, marketing, accounting, and many more. It also offers out-of-the-box artificial intelligence and business intelligence capabilities, along with customization tools to tailor the system to a business's needs.

3. **Other notable mentions**:
   - **Shopify Plus**, **MS Dynamics 365**, **Striven**, and **Timely** among others, each with a unique set of features and capabilities tailored towards business management.

Your project seems to take a more AI-centric approach, particularly with the use of GPT-powered agents for each microservice, which is a distinct feature not observed in the competitors listed. Additionally, your system seems to have a strong focus on ethical considerations, regular training, and updates for AI agents, which may offer a unique selling proposition in terms of privacy, transparency, and addressing biases.

However, competitors like Zoho One and Connecteam also offer a broad suite of integrated applications covering various business functions. They have established a presence in the market with a substantial user base, making the competition quite substantial. Your project's success may hinge on the robustness of the AI integration, the effectiveness of the GPT-powered agents, and how well the system addresses the ethical concerns associated with AI.

In summary, while there's stiff competition in the small business administrative system space, your AI-centric approach and ethical considerations could set your system apart, provided they are executed effectively and add significant value to the end-users.
