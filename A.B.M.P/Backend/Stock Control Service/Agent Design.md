## Chain Design:

### 1. **Inventory Overview Chain**:

- **Step 1**: Fetch all items (`GET /items`).
- **Step 2**: For each item, fetch the current stock level (`GET /stock-levels/{item_id}`).
- **Step 3**: Analyze stock levels to identify low stock or out-of-stock items.
- **Step 4**: Categorize items as fast-moving or slow-moving based on historical stock movement data.

### 2. **Stock Search Chain**:

- **Step 1**: Receive a search query.
- **Step 2**: If searching by name, SKU, or category, fetch matching item(s) (`GET /items` or `GET /items/{item_id}`).
- **Step 3**: For the searched item(s), fetch current stock level and other details.

### 3. **Stock Updates Chain**:

- **Step 1**: Receive update request.
- **Step 2**: If adding new items, send request to `POST /items`.
- **Step 3**: If updating stock levels, send request to `PUT /stock-levels/{item_id}`.
- **Step 4**: If removing items, send request to `DELETE /items/{item_id}`.

### 4. **Reorder Alerts Chain**:

- **Step 1**: Monitor stock levels (`GET /stock-levels/{item_id}` for all items).
- **Step 2**: If stock level reaches reorder point, generate a reorder alert.
- **Step 3**: Suggest reorder quantities based on historical sales data
### 5. **Stock Movement Tracking Chain**:

- **Step 1**: Log new stock movements (`POST /stock-movements`).
- **Step 2**: Fetch log of all stock movements (`GET /stock-movements`) for auditing or review.

### 6. **Supplier Management Chain**:

- **Step 1**: If new supplier, send request to `POST /suppliers`.
- **Step 2**: If updating supplier details, send request to `PUT /suppliers/{supplier_id}`.
- **Step 3**: If removing a supplier, send request to `DELETE /suppliers/{supplier_id}`.
- **Step 4**: Notify when it's time to reorder from a supplier based on stock levels and reorder points.

### 7. **Stock Valuation Chain**:

- **Step 1**: Fetch all items (`GET /items`).
- **Step 2**: Calculate the total value of the current stock based on cost prices (may require additional API route for fetching cost prices).
- **Step 3**: Identify the most valuable items in stock based on valuation.

### 8. **Price Change Chain**:

This chain is designed to handle price changes for all items from a specific supplier.

- **Step 1**: Identify the supplier whose prices are changing.
- **Step 2**: Fetch all items from this supplier (this may require a new API route, e.g., `GET /items/supplier/{supplier_id}`).
- **Step 3**: For each item, update the price information (`PUT /items/{item_id}`). This step might require input on the new prices or a method to calculate the new prices based on given criteria.
- **Step 4**: (Optional) Notify relevant stakeholders about the price change, if needed.

### 9. **Batch Management Chain**:

This chain is designed to manage batches of items. for this

- **Step 1**: Receive batch management request (e.g., adding a new batch, updating a batch, or removing a batch).
- **Step 2**:
    - If adding a new batch: Send request to `POST /batches`.
    - If updating a batch: Send request to `PUT /batches/{batch_id}` with updated details.
    - If removing a batch: Send request to `DELETE /batches/{batch_id}`.
- **Step 3**: Update the stock levels of the items in the batch (`PUT /stock-levels/{item_id}`).
- **Step 4**: (Optional) Log the batch management operation for auditing purposes (`POST /stock-movements`).

### Chain Dependencies:

Some chains may depend on the outputs of other chains. For example, the Reorder Alerts Chain may depend on data from the Inventory Overview Chain. In such cases, you'll need to ensure that dependent chains are executed in the correct order, and data is passed correctly from one chain to the next. This means that we will use a chain of chains.
