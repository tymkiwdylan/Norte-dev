        - `DELETE /items/{item_id}`: Remove an item.
    - **Stock Levels**:
        - `GET /stock-levels/{item_id}`: Get the current stock level of a specific item.
        - `PUT /stock-levels/{item_id}`: Update the stock level of a specific item.
    - **Stock Movements**:
        - `GET /stock-movements`: Retrieve a log of all stock movements.
        - `POST /stock-movements`: Log a new stock movement.
    - **Suppliers**:
        - `GET /suppliers`: Retrieve a list of all suppliers.
        - `POST /suppliers`: Add a new supplier.
        - `GET /suppliers/{supplier_id}`: Retrieve details of a specific supplier.
        - `PUT /suppliers/{supplier_id}`: Update details of a specific supplier.
        - `DELETE /suppliers/{supplier_id}`: Remove a supplier.
    - **Batches** (if applicable):
        - `GET /batches/{item_id}`: Retrieve batches of a specific item.
        - `POST /batches`: Add a new batch.
        - `PUT /batches/{batch_id}`: Update details of a specific batch.
        - `DELETE /batches/{batch_id}`: Remove a batch.
    - **Locations** (if applicable):
        - `GET /locations`: Retrieve a list of all locations.
        - `POST /locations`: Add a new location.
        - `GET /locations/{location_id}`: Retrieve details of a specific location.
        - `PUT /locations/{location_id}`: Update details of a specific location.
        - `DELETE /locations/{location_id}`: Remove a location.
3. **Business Logic**:
    
    - **Reorder Alerts**: Logic to determine when stock levels reach the reorder point and trigger alerts.
    - **Stock Valuation**: Logic to calculate the total value of the current stock based on cost prices.
    - **Stock Forecasting**: Logic to predict future stock requirements based on historical data and trends.
4. **Integration**:
    
    - **Sales System**: Integrate with the sales system to automatically update stock levels after a sale.
    - **Purchasing System**: Integrate with the purchasing system to update stock levels after receiving goods.
5. **Authentication & Authorization**:
    
    - Ensure secure access to the microservice.
    - Implement role-based access control, so only authorized personnel can make changes to stock levels, add/remove items, etc.
6. **Error Handling & Logging**:
    
    - Implement error handling to manage any issues that arise.
    - Log all actions for auditing purposes.
7. **Testing**:
    
    - Unit tests for all business logic.
    - Integration tests for all API endpoints.
    - Load tests to ensure the microservice can handle a large number of requests.
