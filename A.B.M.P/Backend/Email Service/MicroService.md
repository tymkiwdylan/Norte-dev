1. **Database (MongoDB)**:
    
    - **Collections**:
        - **Users**: Contains details of each user, such as user ID, email address, name, and email preferences.
        - **Emails**: Logs all incoming and outgoing emails, including timestamps, content, status (sent, delivered, read), attachments, etc.
        - **Templates**: Pre-defined email templates for common notifications or messages.
        - **Automated Responses**: Contains predefined responses for frequently received emails or common user inputs.
2. **API Endpoints (Flask)**:
    
    - **Users**:
        - `GET /users`: Retrieve a list of all users.
        - `POST /users`: Add a new user.
        - `GET /users/{user_id}`: Retrieve details of a specific user.
        - `PUT /users/{user_id}`: Update details of a specific user.
        - `DELETE /users/{user_id}`: Remove a user.
    - **Emails**:
        - `GET /emails/{user_id}`: Retrieve all emails for a specific user.
        - `POST /emails`: Send a new email.
        - `GET /emails/{email_id}`: Retrieve details of a specific email.
        - `DELETE /emails/{email_id}`: Delete a specific email.
    - **Templates**:
        - `GET /templates`: Retrieve all email templates.
        - `POST /templates`: Add a new email template.
        - `PUT /templates/{template_id}`: Update a specific email template.
        - `DELETE /templates/{template_id}`: Remove an email template.
    - **Automated Responses**:
        - `GET /responses`: Retrieve all automated responses.
        - `POST /responses`: Add a new automated response.
        - `PUT /responses/{response_id}`: Update a specific automated response.
        - `DELETE /responses/{response_id}`: Remove an automated response.
3. **Integration with Email Providers**:
    
    - Utilize SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) for sending emails.
    - Use IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) or POP3 (Post Office Protocol) for receiving emails.
    - Integrate with third-party email services like SendGrid, Mailgun, or Amazon SES if required.
4. **Business Logic**:
    
    - **Automated Response Handling**: Logic to detect common email content and respond with predefined answers.
    - **Notification System**: Logic to send notifications or alerts to users based on specific triggers or events.
    - **Email Filtering**: Logic to categorize and filter emails based on content, sender, or other criteria.
    - **Attachment Handling**: Logic to handle email attachments, including saving, retrieving, and scanning for malware.
5. **Authentication & Authorization**:
    
    - Ensure secure access to the microservice.
    - Implement role-based access control, so only authorized personnel can send emails, manage templates, etc.
6. **Error Handling & Logging**:
    
    - Implement error handling to manage any issues that arise, especially considering the real-time nature of email communication.
    - Log all actions, especially incoming and outgoing emails, for auditing and analysis purposes.
7. **Testing**:
    
    - Unit tests for all business logic.
    - Integration tests for all API endpoints and email provider integration.
    - Load tests to ensure the microservice can handle a large number of emails and users.
