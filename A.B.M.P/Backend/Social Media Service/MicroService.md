### Social Media Utility Service:

1. **Database (MongoDB)**:
   - **Collections**:
     - **Accounts**: Contains details of each social media account, such as username, platform (Instagram or Twitter), authentication tokens, and preferences.
     - **Posts**: Logs all posts made by the user, including timestamps, content, media attachments, and engagement metrics (likes, retweets, comments, etc.).
     - **Scheduled Posts**: Details of posts scheduled for future publishing.
     - **Mentions**: Logs of mentions or interactions from other users on both platforms.

2. **API Endpoints (Flask)**:
   - **Accounts**:
     - `GET /accounts`: Retrieve a list of all linked social media accounts.
     - `POST /accounts`: Link a new social media account.
     - `DELETE /accounts/{account_id}`: Unlink a specific social media account.
   - **Posts**:
     - `GET /posts/{account_id}`: Retrieve all posts for a specific account.
     - `POST /posts`: Create a new post or schedule a post for later.
     - `DELETE /posts/{post_id}`: Delete a specific post.
   - **Mentions**:
     - `GET /mentions/{account_id}`: Retrieve all mentions or interactions for a specific account.

3. **Integration with Social Media APIs**:
   - **Instagram API**:
     - Fetch user profile details, posts, and engagement metrics.
     - Publish new posts or stories.
     - Monitor mentions or interactions.
   - **Twitter API**:
     - Fetch user profile details, tweets, and engagement metrics.
     - Publish new tweets or retweets.
     - Monitor mentions, replies, and interactions.

4. **Business Logic**:
   - **Post Scheduling**: Logic to automatically publish scheduled posts at the specified time.
   - **Engagement Analysis**: Analyze engagement metrics to provide insights into post performance, best times to post, audience demographics, etc.
   - **Mention Alerts**: Real-time alerts for mentions or interactions, especially for important or verified accounts.
   - **Content Recommendations**: Based on past engagement, recommend content topics or formats that are likely to perform well.

5. **Authentication & Authorization**:
   - Securely authenticate with Instagram and Twitter using OAuth or other relevant authentication methods.
   - Ensure secure access to the microservice and implement role-based access control.

6. **Error Handling & Logging**:
   - Handle errors, especially those related to API rate limits, failed posts, or authentication issues.
   - Log all actions, especially posts and interactions, for auditing and analysis purposes.

7. **Testing**:
   - Unit tests for all business logic and post scheduling.
   - Integration tests for all API endpoints and social media API integrations.
   - Load tests to ensure the microservice can handle a large number of posts, mentions, and interactions.

By structuring the Social Media Utility Service in this manner, you can efficiently manage your presence on Instagram and Twitter, automate common tasks, and gain insights into your social media performance.
